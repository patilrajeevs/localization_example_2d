# localization_example_2d
Move over a 2d map of "G"(green) and "R"(red) blocks, and localize using the measurements and movement expectations

A 2d Map with either "G" or "R" cell is give. Given vertical or horizontal movements and measurements, at the end of the "move - measure" cycle, the "robot" must be localized, i.e. identify in which cell it is located.

This is an excercise to understand the very basic step of localization. The problem statement and test cases are taken from udacity's classroom.
